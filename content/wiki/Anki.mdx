# Anki

Anki (from Japanese <ruby>暗<rp>(</rp><rt>あん</rt><rp>)</rp>記<rp>(</rp><rt>き</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>, memorization)
is a SRS (spaced repetition system, think flashcards) software.

Many people use it for learning languages. There are community-curated
vocabulary packs available for free. It's also commonly used for
medical school, or memorizing things like country flags, morse code, etc.

I think Anki can be adapted further into one's lifestyle. By the "use it or lose it"
principle, for virtually anything that you would want to keep in your memory, you
could benefit from Anki. Personally, I used it for interview preparation: I created
decks from Leetcode questions with verbal descriptions of solutions, and for system
design related subjects.

Since my website is [NotABlog](!), it's easy to incorporate Anki into the flow. I can
create Anki decks from my own pages (and can actually automate this via scripting) so
that learning becomes a creative process: I learn, I take notes to the wiki, create
decks, and both of us can learn (the reader and the author).
