# ASMR

I listen to a lot of ASMR channels on YouTube. Among my favorites are:

- [Dr. T ASMR](https://www.youtube.com/c/DrTinglesASMR)
- [Ephemeral Rift](https://www.youtube.com/c/EphemeralRift)
- [Gibi ASMR](https://www.youtube.com/c/GibiASMR)
- [RaffyTaphyASMR](https://www.youtube.com/c/RaffyTaphyASMR)
- [MehtapZiyagilASMR](https://www.youtube.com/c/MehtapZiyagilASMR)
- [asmr zeitgeist](https://www.youtube.com/c/asmrzeitgeist)
- [PierreG ASMR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVJhw7syDk4)

I don't appreciate how much ASMR has been sexualized over the recent years. The popularity of
channels like Amouranth, etc. is definitely affecting people's opinions of ASMR, they are often
led to believe that ASMR is some sort of weird SFW porn.

Another thing I really don't understand is why ASMR content is still being produced today.
There should be over hundreds of thousands of hours of ASMR content available on YouTube,
and an extremely wide variety of subgenres/ideas were explored. Can't people keep watching
the old videos? It's not like they will run out any time soon.
