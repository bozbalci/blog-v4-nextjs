# NotABlog

This website is not a blog (and will probably remain that way forever).

Blogs are the most commonly encountered species of personal websites. They are chronological
manifestations of the author's thoughts, ideas and experiences told in a long-form text.

Wikis, on the other hand, provide a structured network of information. Usually viewers have
more freedom of navigation, and the information is presented in a more dense form
(no story-telling overhead compared to blogs).

For this website, I wanted to make it a wiki, because I seem to be an eternal procrastinator
when it comes to authoring blog posts. I cannot find the motivation to write blog posts,
because I always think that they will end up being uninteresting to everyone in the world—it's
hard to come up with a distilled story that people can read in under ten minutes and leave
with a positive impression. It's easier and more natural for me to start building a
foundation—primarily for myself—and then improve upon it incrementally, until (hopefully)
it becomes interesting to people. In the worst case scenario, I will end up having a wiki,
which is a good thing.
