# Uses

Inspired by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/uses), I've put together a list of everything I use to produce my work. See [`@wesbos/awesome-uses`](https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses) for other pages like this.

## Hardware

- **Personal Workstation**

  My personal workstation is my own custom build. It features a 6-core Ryzen 5 3600 CPU, 32 GB of RAM, and an Nvidia RTX 2070 Super graphics card.
  I use Windows 11 with [WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/). In the past, I have used a variety of \*nix operating systems (Fedora,
  Debian, Arch Linux, FreeBSD) but I have had issues with their desktop usage (mostly about high-resolution monitors, fractional scaling and issues with both
  Xorg and Wayland).

- **16-inch MacBook Pro (2019)**

  This is my current work-issued machine that is an absolute nightmare to use in summers (works OK-ish during winters, though).

- **10.5-inch iPad Pro (2019) with Apple Pencil**

  My main portable computing device is an iPad Pro. They have completely replaced pen-and-paper for creating mock-ups or visualizing
  software designs.

- [**2x Samsung LU28R55 28-inch 4K monitors**](https://www.samsung.com/hk_en/business/monitors/monitors-ur550/lu28r550uqcxxk/)

  I run a dual monitor setup. They come in especially handy when you need to look at documentation, or the website build on a separate
  monitor. These displays are great and their minimally-bezeled design is an absolute delight to look at.

- [**Logitech C270 HD Webcam**](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/webcams/c270-hd-webcam.960-000694.html)

  This was the cheapest webcam that was available to purchase during the COVID-19 pandemic, a time when it was difficult to get your hands on a webcam.
  It is only 720p, and has a very narrow field of view, but it works well for my setup. It also includes a microphone.

## Editor + Terminal

- **Visual Studio Code**

  I have been using Vim for text editing for more than 10 years and I still cannot edit text using anything else. However, as I grew professionally and have been involved
  in larger projects, I've found some use in using an IDE. Make no mistake, Vim (and Unix utilities) can [absolutely be used as an IDE](https://blog.sanctum.geek.nz/series/unix-as-ide/),
  especially with (relatively) recent advancements such as [LSP (Language Server Protocol)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/). Among many modern GUI text editors I've
  tested over the years, I found that Visual Studio Code has the best [Vim emulation](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim), has the best performance, and the
  best community-created plugins and language support.

- **Hyper and iTerm2**

  I use [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) on Windows and [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) on macOS.

- [**Iosevka**](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka)

  Iosevka is my favorite monospace typeface family, ever. It has a lot of variants (you can easily generate your own), great language support, programming ligatures, and many other features.
  I stumbled upon it when looking for alternatives since I couldn't afford Pragmata Pro, and haven't used another monospace font ever since.

- **Dot Files**

  My configuration files are hosted on GitHub, but currently in a private repository as it's not ready to be made public just yet. Stay tuned.

## Desk, chair and lighting

- [**Dark VM200 Dual Monitor Arm**](https://www.hepsiburada.com/dark-vm200-13-32-2-adet-monitor-destekli-amortisorlu-masa-monte-monitor-kolu-dk-ac-vm200-p-HBV00000L4ECI?magaza=Teknobiyotik)

  I have mounted my dual monitors onto this arm. One great feature is the cable management. It's also supposed to be a very versatile tool, but I found that I can't always get my monitors to
  perfectly align, or stand at a good angle when positioned vertically. Still, I don't have any major complaints and have been using them for over a year.

## Audio

- [**Sennheiser HD 599**](https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-HD-599-Open-Headphone/dp/B01L1IICR2)

  These open-back headphones are my preferred equipment when indoors. This model is very comfortable, I can wear it for hours without fatigue and they have
  huge cushions—a perfect fit for my large head.

- **Apple AirPods Pro**

  I use the AirPods when outside or indoors in video conferencing. However, in Zoom calls I always use the internal microphone of the MacBook Pro because
  other participants have reported that it sounds vastly better.

- **Creative A320**

  I have been using these speakers for more than 10 years and they sound amazing.

## Picture

I uploaded a picture of my setup in a tweet. It's slightly outdated but it should give the rough idea.
