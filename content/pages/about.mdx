# About

Hi. I'm Berk Özbalcı, a software engineer living in Ankara, Turkey.

I work at [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), helping over 30 million
students and over 42,000 instructors have a smooth payments experience
on our platform.

I sing the bass part in [Jazzberry Tunes](https://jazzberrytunes.com),
an _a cappella_ choir founded in 2014 by students of Middle East
Technical University. We've been to [Les Choralies](https://choralies.fr/en/home/)
in 2019, and we're invited to participate in the
[Béla Bartók International Choir Competition (BBCC)](http://bbcc.hu/en/overview/)
in 2022.

## This website

This site is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It is somehow hosted freely on
[Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

### Origin of the name

I took a [theoretical linguistics](https://github.com/bozbalci/cogs532)
class in college, and in the introduction to morphology our instructor
gave us the two conceivable breakdowns of the word "unsystematic" into
its morphemes:

<div className="text-center">
  <Image src="/images/parse1.png" alt="alt" width="148" height="122" />
  <Image src="/images/parse2.png" alt="alt" width="148" height="122" />
</div>

One makes more sense than the other—but why? Questions like this are my jam.

The idea that our world could have "unsystems" along with "systems" was really
fun for me, and I decided to name my site after it. What does unsystem mean?
Well, it's up to you.
