# About

Hi. I'm Berk Özbalcı, a senior software engineer living in London. I work at Apple, in the Apple Pay team.

## This website

Fascinated by the Web from early childhood, I built this website as a digital self-expression and organization tool for myself.
I think that's what the platform was originally invented for, although every day we are straying further from that vision.

This site is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It is somehow hosted freely on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

I use the [system font stack](https://systemfontstack.com/) throughout the website.

Most of the content is written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) (Markdown plus JSX).

The favicon for this website has been generated by [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/). It's the Japanese kana character ベ (be), which is the first syllable of my name in transliteration.

If you would like to learn more about my setup, I have a [page for that, too.](/uses)
