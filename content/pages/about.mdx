# About

Hi. I'm Berk Özbalcı, a software engineer living in Ankara, Turkey. I work at [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), helping over 30 million students and over 42,000 instructors have a smooth payments experience on our platform.

As a semi-professional musician, I sing the bass part in [Jazzberry Tunes](https://jazzberrytunes.com), an _a cappella_ choir founded in 2014 by students of Middle East Technical University. We've been to [Les Choralies](https://choralies.fr/en/home/) in 2019, and we're invited to participate in the [Béla Bartók International Choir Competition (BBCC)](http://bbcc.hu/en/overview/) in 2022. As a member of the executive committee, I am also leading the efforts to revamp our brand identity, introducing quality management processes, and so on.

## This website

Fascinated by the Web from early childhood, I built this website as a digital hub for all of my online presence. I try to adhere to the [IndieWeb principles](https://indieweb.org/principles) as much as I can.

This site is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It is somehow hosted freely on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

I use the [system font stack](https://systemfontstack.com/) for sans-serif and monospace, and [Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display) for serif.

Most of the content is written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) (Markdown plus JSX).

The favicon for this website has been generated by [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/). It's the Japanese kana character ベ (be), which is the first syllable of my name in transliteration.
